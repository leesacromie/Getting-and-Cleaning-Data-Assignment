Varibles

**Activities**

There are 6 activities the subject being obeserved could be doing while this data recorded using the smart device.

laying - Laying down
sitting - Sitting down
standing - Standing up.
walking - Walking around.
walkingupstairs - Walking Upstairs
walkingdownstairs - Walking Downstairs

**Subject Id**
As per the Readme there are a total of 30 subject and they have each been assigned a number 1 - 30.

subjectid - The number assigned to the subject being observed

**Recorded Values**
As per the Readme and features_info files smart device has an accelerometer and gyroscope that it records signals from. The accelerometer has two components the body component and the gravity component. All signals have a x,y and z component. All of these are recorded in respect to the time domain. The features_info file explains how these signals are used to calculate a further 552 observations in both the time and frequency domains. The accelerometer values are in m/sec^2 and the angular velocity is in rad/sec
